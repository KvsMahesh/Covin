# Covin

http://covinvaccine.herokuapp.com/

Made a Website using cowin api to display Vaccination centers. 

Pincode, Date and age group input are taken from a form which then sends an api request and displays Centers, No. of Vaccines available, Vaccine type, Slot times and directions to the center.

Used Flask for the backend, HTML and Bootstrap for the frontend. Used Cowin api for api calls.
